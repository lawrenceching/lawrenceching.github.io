# Generate my blog website in a dev way

An accident ruined my laptop and I lost all my data of my previous blog. 
The backup mechanism was not functional sometime and somehow.
So I have no way to recover my raw data.

Taking this chance, I'm going to try another way to manage my blog post.
A way that very similar to how I writing program in my day-to-day work.

## MWeb, sorry

I used MWeb before. It's awesome but it's not my cup of tea.
I must prefer Bear style for writing markdown article. In the past 3 or 4 years, I used MWeb as a blog management tool. I used it to generate html file from markdown file. It’s cool, but … I’m a developer, using 3rd part tool to generate html sounds just suck.

## Hexo and Jekyll
I admitted Hexo and Jekyll are awesome. I tried for a period and found it’s too complicated, for such a small thing of just converting md to html.

## In a dev way
So eventually I decided to turn all my blog pages into a pure, simple UI project.
Npm, gulp, showdown.js and of cause my UI development skills. Now I’m feeling extremely good XD.
Nothing worth to talk, it’s easy to get it done if you’re a dev but if you’re interested in, check out:
